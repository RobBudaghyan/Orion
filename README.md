The main goal of the application is the security of the messages, because it's working principle excludes any third party from accessing the messages (see ????? for more). The message sent to user is stored encrypted in database, until it is opened by the user. When the message is opened by the receiver, it is automaticaly deleted from database.

## How To Use

#### Send Message

In order to send a message to a user, you need to have user's ID (every user has its own unique ID). Then write the message in message input space, and press "Send" button.

#### Receive Message

When a user sends you a message, a notification of a new message will appear in lower space. The notifications contains information about the date when the message has been received and the ID of the sender. Note that when you open the message it will be automatically DELETED and you can NEVER recover it's content.
